## Rules of programming 👋


  1. make it correct (make it work)
  2. make it readable (refactor code for better orientation, easy to understand)
  3. make it small (reduce number of code lines)
  4. make it simple (change code to make it more beautiful, easier to read and understand) 
  5. make it fast (change algorithm, use benchmarks, make tests)
